\paragraph{M\"obius action on oriented circlines.} On the
representation level, the M\"obius action on an oriented circline is
the same as on to an unoriented circline.  {\tt
  \begin{tabbing}

\noindent M\"obius action on (unoriented) circlines could have been
defined using the action on oriented circlines, but not the other way
around.  {\tt
  \begin{tabbing}
    \hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\kill

\>in  $H_1$ = $H_2$ $\vee$ $H_1$ = $\oppocircline{H_2}$"
  \end{tabbing}
}

\noindent M\"obius actions on oriented circlines have similar
properties as M\"obius actions on unoriented ones. For example, they
agree with inverse ({\tt {\bf lemma} "mobius\_o\_circline (mobius\_inv
  $M$) = inv (mobius\_o\_circline $M$)"}), with composition, identity
transformation, they are injective ({\tt inj mobius\_circline}), and so
on. The central lemmas in this section connects the action of M\"obius
transformations on points, on oriented circlines, and discs.

All Euclidean similarities preserve circline orientation.

  \end{tabbing}
}

\noindent Orientation of the image of a given oriented circline $H$
under a given M\"obius transformation $M$ depends on whether the pole
of $M$ (the point that $M$ maps to $\infty_{hc}$) lies in the disc or
in the disc complement of $H$ (if it is on the set of $H$, then it
maps onto a line and we do not discuss the orientation).

{\tt
  \begin{tabbing}
  \hspace{3mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\kill
{\bf lemma}\\
\>"$0_{hc}$ $\in$ disc\_compl $H$ $\Longrightarrow$ pos\_o\_circline (mobius\_o\_circline reciprocation $H$)"\\

\>\>"pole $M$ $\in$ disc\_compl $H$ $\longrightarrow$ pos\_o\_circline (mobius\_o\_circline $M$ $H$)"
  \end{tabbing}
}

\noindent Note that this is different to what is claimed by
Schwerdtfeger \cite{schwerdtfeger}: ,,Reciprocation preserves the
orientation of a circle which does not contain 0, but inverts the
orientation of any circle containing 0 as an interior point. Every
M\"obius transformation preserves the orientation of any circle that
does not contain its pole. If circle contains its pole, then the image
circle has its orientation opposite.''. Our formalization shows that
the orientation of the resulting circles does not depend on the
orientation of the initial one (e.g., in the case of reciprocation,
the orientation of the initial circle shows the relative position of
the circle and the infinite point that is determined by the sign of
the coefficient $A$ in a representation matrix and that is independent
issue of the relative position of the circle and the zero point that
is determined by the sign of the coefficient $D$ --- these two
coefficients are exchanged by reciprocation).

\paragraph{Angle preservation.}
M\"obius transformations are conformal, meaning that they preserve
oriented angle between oriented circlines.  If angle is defined in
purely algebraic terms (following Schwerdtfeger \cite{schwerdtfeger}),
then this property is a very easy to prove. We also print the
definition of a mixed determinant defined in our background theory of
linear algebra. {\tt
  \begin{tabbing}
    \hspace{3mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\kill

\> cos\_angle (moebius\_o\_circline $M$ $H_1$) (moebius\_o\_circline $M$ $H\_2$)"
  \end{tabbing}
}

However, this definition is not intuitive, and for pedagogical reasons
we want to connect it to the more common definition. First, we define
the angle between two complex vectors ($\downharpoonright \_
\downharpoonleft$ denotes the angle normalization function described
earlier). {\tt
  \begin{tabbing}
    \hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\kill
{\bf definition} ang\_vec ("$\measuredangle$") {\bf where} "$\measuredangle$ $z_1$ $z_2$ = $\downharpoonright$arg $z_2$ - arg $z_1$$\downharpoonleft$"    
  \end{tabbing}
}

Given a center $\mu$ of an ordinary Euclidean circle and a point $z$ on
it, we define the tangent vector in $z$ as the radius vector
$\overrightarrow{\mu z}$, rotated by $\pi/2$, clockwise or
counterclockwise, depending on the circle orientation.
{\tt
  \begin{tabbing}
    \hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\kill
{\bf definition} tang\_vec :: "complex $\Rightarrow$ complex $\Rightarrow$ bool $\Rightarrow$ complex" {\bf where}\\
\>"tang\_vec $\mu$ $z$ $p$ = sgn\_bool $p$ * $i$ * ($z$ - $\mu$)"
  \end{tabbing}
}
\noindent The Boolean $p$ encodes the orientation of the circle, and
the function {\tt sgn\_bool $p$} returns $1$ when $p$ is true, and
$-1$ for when $p$ is false. Finally, angle between two oriented
circles at their common point $z$ is defined as the angle between
tangent vectors at $z$.

{\tt
  \begin{tabbing}
    \hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\kill
{\bf definition} ang\_circ {\bf where}\\
\> "ang\_circ $z$ $\mu_1$ $\mu_2$ $p_1$ $p_2$ = $\measuredangle$ (tang\_vec $\mu_1$ $z$ $p_1$) (tang\_vec $\mu_2$ $z$ $p_2$)"
  \end{tabbing}
}

\noindent Finally, the connection between algebraic and geometric definition of
angle cosine is given by the following lemma.

{\tt
  \begin{tabbing}
    \hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\kill
{\bf lemma} {\bf assumes} "is\_circle ($\ofocircline{H_1}$)" "is\_circle ($\ofocircline{H_2}$)"\\

\>\>  "($\mu_1$, $r_1$) = euclidean\_circle ($\ofocircline{H_1}$)"\\
\>\>  "($\mu_2$, $r_2$) = euclidean\_circle ($\ofocircline{H_2}$)"\\
\>\>  "of\_complex $z$ $\in$ o\_circline\_set H1 $\cap$ o\_circline\_set H2"\\
\>{\bf shows} "\=cos\_angle $H_1$ $H_2$ = \\
\>\>cos (ang\_circ $z$ $\mu_1$ $\mu_2$ (pos\_o\_circline $H_1$) (pos\_o\_circline $H_2$))"
  \end{tabbing}
}
\noindent To prove this lemma we needed to show the law of cosines in
Isabelle/HOL, but it turned out to be a very easy task.

\subsection{Some Important Subgroups of M\"obius Transformations}
\label{subsec:classification}

We have already described the parabolic group (the group of Euclidean
similarities), crucial for the Euclidean plane geometry. Now we will
describe characterizations of two very important subgroups of the
M\"obius group --- the group of sphere rotations, important for the
elliptic plane geometry, and the group of disc automorphisms important
for the hyperbolic plane geometry.

\paragraph{Sphere rotations.}
General unitary group, denoted by $GU_2(\mathbb{C})$ is the group that
contains all M\"obius transformations represented by generalized
unitary matrices.  {\tt
  \begin{tabbing}
    \hspace{3mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\kill
{\bf definition} unitary\_gen {\bf where}\\
\>"unitary\_gen $M$ $\longleftrightarrow$ $(\exists$ $k$::complex. $k \neq 0$ $\wedge$ mat\_adj $M *_{mm} M$ = $k$ $*_{sm}$ eye$)$"
  \end{tabbing}
}

\noindent Although the definition allows any complex factor $k$, it
turns out that $k$ can only be real. Generalized unitary matrices can
be factored into ordinary unitary matrices and positive multiples of
the identity matrix.

{\tt
  \begin{tabbing}
    \hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\kill
{\bf definition} unitary {\bf where} "unitary $M$ $\longleftrightarrow$ mat\_adj $M *_{mm} M$ = eye"\\
{\bf lemma} "unitary\_gen $M$ $\longleftrightarrow$ \\
\> $($$\exists\ k\ M'$. $k > 0$ $\wedge$ unitary $M'$ $\wedge$ $M$ = (cor $k$ $*_{sm}$ eye) $*_{mm}$ $M'$)"
  \end{tabbing}
}

The group of unitary matrices is very important as it describes all
rotations of the Riemann sphere (it is isomorphic to the real special
orthogonal group $SO_3(\mathbb{R})$). One characterization of
$GU_2(\mathbb{C})$ in $\extC$ is that it is a group of transformations
that leave the imaginary unit circle fixed (this is the circle with
the identity representation matrix, contained in the plane at
infinity).

{\tt
  \begin{tabbing}
    \hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\kill
{\bf lemma} "mat\_det $(A, B, C, D)$ $\neq 0$ $\Longrightarrow$ unitary\_gen ($A$, $B$, $C$, $D$)  $\longleftrightarrow$\\
\>moebius\_circline (mk\_moebius $A$ $B$ $C$ $D$) imag\_unit\_circle = \\
\>imag\_unit\_circle"
  \end{tabbing}
}


The characterization of generalized unitary matrices in coordinates is
given by the following lemma.  {\tt
  \begin{tabbing}
    \hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\kill
{\bf lemma} "unitary\_gen M $\longleftrightarrow$ $($$\exists$ $a$ $b$ $k$.\ let $M' = (a,\,b,\,-\mathtt{cnj}\ b,\,\mathtt{cnj}\ a)$ in \\
\>$k \neq 0$ $\wedge$ mat\_det $M' \neq 0$ $\wedge$ $M = k *_{sm} M'$$)$"
  \end{tabbing}
}

Along the way we have also defined the special unitary group
$SU_2(\mathbb{C})$, containing generalized unitary matrices with unit
determinant (they are recognized by the form $(a,\,b,\,-\mathtt{cnj}\
b,\,\mathtt{cnj}\ a)$, without the multiple $k$, and we used this to
derive the coordinate form of generalized unitary matrices).

\paragraph{Disc automorphisms.}
A dual group to the previous one is the group of generalized unitary
matrices with the $1-1$ signature ($GU_{1,1}(\mathbb{C})$).

{\tt
  \begin{tabbing}
    \hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\kill
{\bf definition} unitary11 {\bf where}\\
\>"unitary11 $M$ $\longleftrightarrow$ mat\_adj $M *_{mm} (1, 0, 0, -1) *_{mm} M = (1, 0, 0, -1)$"\\
{\bf definition} unitary11\_gen {\bf where}\\
\>"unitary11\_gen $M$ $\longleftrightarrow$ $(\exists$ $k$::complex. $k \neq 0$ $\wedge$\\
\>\>mat\_adj $M$ $*_{mm} (1, 0, 0, -1) *_{mm}$ $M$ = $k$ $*_{sm}$ $(1, 0, 0, -1)$$)$"
  \end{tabbing}
}
\noindent Again, the definition allows a complex factor $k$, but it is
shown that only real factors are plausible.

A characterization of the $GU_{1,1}(\mathbb{C})$ is that it contains
all M\"obius transformations that leaves the unit circle fixed.

{\tt
  \begin{tabbing}
    \hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\kill
{\bf lemma} "mat\_det $(A, B, C, D)$ $\neq 0$ $\Longrightarrow$ unitary11\_gen ($A$, $B$, $C$, $D$)  $\longleftrightarrow$\\
\>moebius\_circline (mk\_moebius $A$ $B$ $C$ $D$) unit\_circle = unit\_circle"
  \end{tabbing}
}

The characterization of generalized unitary 1-1 matrices in coordinates is given by the following lemmas.
{\tt
  \begin{tabbing}
    \hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\kill
{\bf lemma} "unitary11\_gen $M$ $\longleftrightarrow$ $($$\exists$ $a$ $b$ $k$. let $M' = (a,\,b,\,\mathtt{cnj}\ b,\,\mathtt{cnj}\ a)$ in \\
\> $k \neq 0$ $\wedge$ mat\_det $M' \neq 0$ $\wedge$ $(M = k *_{sm} M'$ $\vee$ $M = k *_{sm} (\mathtt{cis}\ pi,\,0,\,0,\,1) *_{sm} M'$$))$\\
{\bf lemma} "unitary11\_gen M $\longleftrightarrow$ $($$\exists$ $a$ $b$ $k$. let $M' = (a,\,b,\,\mathtt{cnj}\ b,\,\mathtt{cnj}\ a)$ in \\
\> $k \neq 0$ $\wedge$ mat\_det $M' \neq 0$ $\wedge$ $M = k *_{sm} M'$ $)$"
  \end{tabbing}
}
\noindent Note that the first lemma is subsumed by the second
one. However, the first lemma was simpler to prove, and gives matrices
of another shape $k *_{sm} (a,\,b,\,-{\tt cnj}\ b,\, -{\tt cnj}\ a)$
--- geometrically, the second kind of transformation combines the
first kind with an additional central symmetry.

Another important characterization of these transformations is via
so-called Blaschke factors. Each transformation is a composition of a
Blaschke factor (a reflection that brings some point that is not on
the unit circle to zero), and a rotation.

{\tt
  \begin{tabbing}
    \hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\kill
{\bf lemma} \={\bf assumes} \="$k \neq 0$" "$M' = (a,\,b,\,\mathtt{cnj}\ b,\,\mathtt{cnj}\ a)$"\\
\>\>"$M = k *_{sm} M'$" "mat\_det $M' \neq 0$" "$a \neq 0$"\\
\hspace{5mm}\=\kill
\>{\bf shows} "\=$\exists$ $k'$ $\phi$ $a'$. $k' \neq 0$ $\wedge$ $a' * \mathtt{cnj}\ a' \neq 1$ $\wedge$\\
\>\> $M = k' *_{sm} (\mathtt{cis}\ \phi,\,0,\,0,\,1) *_{mm} (1,\,-a',\,-\mathtt{cnj}\ a',\,1)$"
  \end{tabbing}
}
\noindent The exceptions come when $a=0$ and then instead of the Blaschke
factor, a reciprocation is used (the infinity plays the role of $a'$
in the previous lemma).  {\tt
  \begin{tabbing}
    \hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\kill
{\bf lemma} \={\bf assumes} \="$k \neq 0$" "$M' = (0,\,b,\,\mathtt{cnj}\ b,\,0)$" "$b \neq 0$" "$M = k *_{sm} M'$" \\
\>{\bf shows} "\=$\exists$ $k'$ $\phi$. $k' \neq 0$ $\wedge$ $M = k' *_{sm} (\mathtt{cis}\ \phi,\,0,\,0,\,1) *_{mm} (0,\,1,\,1,\,0)$"
  \end{tabbing}
}

Matrices of $GU_{1,1}(\mathbb{C})$ naturally split into two
subgroups. All transformations fix the unit circle, but the first
subgroup consists of transformations that map the unit disc to itself
(so called \emph{disc automorphisms}), while the second subgroup
consists of transformations that exchange the unit disc and its
complement. Given a matrix, its subgroup can be determined only on by
looking at the sign of the determinant of $M' = (a,\,b,\,\mathtt{cnj}\
b,\,\mathtt{cnj}\ a)$. If only $M = (a_1, b_1, c_1, d_1)$, and not
$M'$ nor $k$ is given, a criterion to determine the subgroup is the
value of $\mathtt{sgn} (\mathtt{Re}\ ((a_1*d_1)/(b_1*c_1)) - 1)$.

Note that all the important subgroups are here described only in pure
algebraic terms. We have also formalized some more geometric proofs
resulting in equivalent characterization to these we have just
described. Additionally, it holds that all analytic disc automorphisms
are compositions of Blaschke factors and rotations (however, the
proofs relies on mathematical analysis, maximum modulus principle, and
the Swartz lemma --- techniques that we did not consider). Even weaker
statement, that all M\"obius disc automorphisms are of this form has
not yet been formally proved (the crucial step is showing that disc
automorphisms fix the unit circle, and that is something that we did
not manage to do without deep topological investigations that we are
currently working on).

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discuss}
Visual, geometric arguments are often used in textbook proofs. As an
example, we will demonstrate one proof of the angle preservation
property of M\"obius transformations often encountered in textbooks on
the subject (in the rest of this section we will follow Needham
\cite{needham} which does not aim to be a very formal book, but,
still, that kind of reasoning is common for many other authors).

First important issue is the notion of angle. Angles can be defined
between oriented, or unoriented curves and angles themselves can be
oriented or unoriented. Needham defines angles between two curves in
the following way: ,,Let $S_1$ and $S_2$ be curves intersecting at
$z$. As illustrated, we may draw their tangent lines $T_1$ and $T_2$
at $z$. The angle between curves $S_1$ and $S_2$ at their common point
$z$ is the acute angle $\alpha$ from $T_1$ to $T_2$. Thus this angle
$\alpha$ has a sign attached to it: the angle between $S_2$ and $S_1$
is minus the illustrated angle between $S_1$ and $S_2$.'' So, the
angle is defined only between unoriented curves (and that is different
from our definition), but the angle itself is oriented (and that is the
same as in our final definition). In our early formalization we have
defined and used the unoriented convex and the acute angle between two
vectors.

{\tt
  \begin{tabbing}
    \hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\kill
{\bf definition} "$\measuredangle_c$" {\bf where} "$\measuredangle_c$ $z_1$ $z_2$ $\equiv$ abs ($\measuredangle$ $z_1$ $z_2$)"\\
{\bf definition} acutize {\bf where} "acutize $\alpha$ = (if $\alpha$ $>$ $\frac{\pi}{2}$ then $\pi$ - $\alpha$ else $\alpha$)"\\
{\bf definition} "$\measuredangle_a$" {\bf where} "$\measuredangle_a$ $z_1$ $z_2$ $\equiv$ acutize ($\measuredangle_c$ $z_1$ $z_2$)"
  \end{tabbing}
}

As our circles were oriented from the beginning, we have shown that the
acute angle between the two circles is not affected by the orientation
and can only be expressed in terms of three points (the intersection
point and the two centers).

{\tt
  \begin{tabbing}
    \hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\kill
{\bf lemma} "$\lbrakk z \neq \mu_1$;$z \neq \mu_2\rbrakk$ $\Longrightarrow$ ang\_circ\_a $z$ $\mu_1$ $\mu_2$ $p_1$ $p_2$ = $\measuredangle_a\ (z - \mu_1)\ (z - \mu_2)$"
\end{tabbing}
}
\noindent The function {\tt ang\_circ\_a} was defined as the acute
angle between the two tangent vectors (similar to {\tt ang\_circ} in
our final formalization).

The angle preservation proof for M\"obius transformations in the
textbook \cite{needham} relies on the fact that each M\"obius
transformation can be decomposed to translations, rotation,
dilatation, and inversion. The fact that translations, rotations, and
dilatations preserve angles is taken for granted (and, to be honest,
formalizing this was rather simple, once the underlying notions were
appropriately formally defined). Therefore, the central challenge is
to show that inversion preserves angles, i.e., that ,,Inversion in a
circle is an anticonformal mapping''. The proof relies on the ,,fact
that given any point $z$ not on the inversion circle $K$, there is
precisely one circle orthogonal to $K$ that passes through $z$ in any
given direction''. Then the proof proceeds ,,Suppose that two curves
$S_1$ and $S_2$ intersect at $z$, and that their tangents there are
$T_1$ and $T_2$, the angle between them being $\alpha$. To find out
what happens to this angle under inversion in $K$, let us replace
$S_1$ and $S_2$ with the unique circles $R_1$ and $R_2$ orthogonal to
$K$ that pass through $z$ in the same directions as directions $S_1$
and $S_2$, i.e., circles whose tangents at $z$ are $T_1$ and
$T_2$. Since inversion in $K$ maps each of these circles to
themselves, the new angle at $\tilde{z}$ is $-\alpha$. Done.''

In our earlier attempts, we have formalized this ,,proof'', but this
required tremendous amount of effort, compared to the sleek algebraic
proof in our final formalization. First, the textbook is often
imprecise in whether it deals with ,,complex inversion'' or
,,geometric inversion'' (i.e., between the reciprocation and the
inversion put in our terms). In the textbook proof, the author uses
inversion over any circle $K$, but it is sufficient to consider only
the reciprocation (always given over the unit circle).  Formalizing
the textbook reasoning only for the reciprocation already gave quite
large formulas, and it would be even more complicated and tedious (if
not impossible) to finish proof using inversion over arbitrary
circle. For example, a simple reciprocation of a circle with a center
$\mu$ and radius $r$ gives a circle with the center $\tilde{\mu} = \mu
/ \mathtt{cor}\ (|\mu|^2 - r^2)$, and radius $\tilde{r} = r / ||\mu|^2
- r^2|$, and this relationship would be much more complex for an
arbitrary M\"obius transformation, if it was written in coordinates,
without using matrix notation as we did in our main formalization.


The formal text of the angle preservation statement was the following.

{\tt
  \begin{tabbing}
    \hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\hspace{5mm}\=\kill
{\bf lemma } \\
 \> {\bf assumes} \= "$z$ $\in$ circle $\mu_1$ $r_1$" "$z$ $\in$ circle $\mu_2$ $r_2$"  \\

  \end{tabbing}
}

Apart from missing discussion of many special cases, the informal
proof misses one key ingredient. Namely, it is easy to prove that the
intersection of $R_1$ and $R_2$ is $\tilde{z}$ (the intersection of
$\tilde{S_1}$ and $\tilde{S_2}$, the images of $S_1$ and $S_2$ under
inversion), but showing that $R_1$ and $\tilde{S_1}$ and that $R_2$
and $\tilde{S_2}$ share tangents at $\tilde{z}$ required not so
trivial calculations (that proof relies on the fact that center
$\mu_i'$ of $R_i$, the center $\tilde{\mu_i}$ of $\tilde{S_i}$, and
$\tilde{z}$ are collinear).

Simple symmetry argument showing that the angles between the circles
in their two different intersection points are the same was again not
so simple to formalize.
{\tt

  \end{tabbing}
}
\noindent We have shown this lemma only after employing ,,wlog''
reasoning and moving the configuration so that the centers of the two
circles are on the x-axis.

In the proof, we have found many degenerate cases that had to be
analyzed separately. First, we had to prove that intersecting circles
can share the same center (i.e., that $\mu_1$$\neq$$\mu_2$) only if
they are the same, and then the acute angle between tangents is $0$.
If the two centers are collinear with the intersection point $z$ (i.e.,
if {\tt collinear $\mu_1$ $\mu_2$ $z$} holds), the two circles touch
(either from inside or from the outside), and again the acute angle is
$0$.

Existence of the circle $R_i$ orthogonal to the unit circle, sharing
the same tangent in the given point $z$ with the given circle centered
in the given point $\mu_i$ is given by the following lemma
(determining its center $\mu_i'$).  {\tt

\noindent The analytic expressions reveal some other degenerate cases.
The numerator of the fraction can be zero only when the circles
intersect on the unit circles (i.e., when $z*\mathtt{cnj}\ z = 1$). In
that case, the textbook proof cannot be adapted, as $\mu_1' = \mu_2' =
z$, and the circles $R_1$ and $R_2$ cannot not be constructed (they
are the empty circles). The case when denominator is zero (either for
$\mu_1'$ or $\mu_2'$) is also degenerate. That happens when vectors
$\mu_i - z$ and $z$ are orthogonal. Geometrically, in that case the
circle $R_i$ degenerates into a line (what is not a problem in the
extended complex plane, but is a problem in the original proof set in
the ordinary complex plane). Therefore, this special case had to be
handled separately. So, our formal analysis quickly shows that the
simple statement in Needham that ,,given any point $z$ not on the
inversion circle $K$, there is precisely one circle orthogonal to $K$
that passes through $z$ in any given direction'' is not true in many
cases.

\section{Conclusions and Further Work}
\label{sec:concl}
In this paper we have described some elements of our formalization of
the geometry of the complex plane $\extC$ both as complex projective
line and the Riemann sphere, arithmetic operations in $\extC$, ratio
and cross-ratio, chordal metric in $\extC$, the group of M\"obius
transformations and their action on $\extC$, some of its special
subgroups (Euclidean similarities, sphere rotations, disk
automorphisms), circlines and their connection with circles and lines,
the chordal metric, and the Riemann sphere, M\"obius action of
circlines, circline uniqueness, circline types and set cardinality,
oriented circlines, relations between M\"obius transformations and the
orientation, angle preservation properties of M\"obius
transformations, etc. Our current development counts around 12,000
lines of Isabelle/HOL code (all proofs are structured and written in
the proof language Isabelle/Isar, and our early attempts that are
subsumed by shorter algebraic proofs are not included), around 125
definitions and around 800 lemmas.

The crucial step in our formalization was our decision to use the
algebraic representation of all relevant objects (vectors of
homogeneous coordinates, matrices for M\"obius transformations,
Hermitean matrices for circlines, etc.). Although this is not a new
approach (for example, Schwerdtfeger's classic book
\cite{schwerdtfeger} follows this approach quite consistently), it is
not so common in the literature (and in the course material available
online). Instead, other, more geometrically oriented approaches
prevail. We have tried to follow that kind of geometric reasoning in
our early work on this subject, but we have encountered many
difficulties and did not have so much success. Based on this
experience, we conclude that introducing the powerful techniques of
linear algebra, makes the work on formalization an order of magnitude
simpler then when using just plain geometric reasoning.

It can be argued that sometimes geometrical arguments give better
explanations of some theorems, but when only justification is
concerned, the algebraic approach is clearly superior. However, to
keep the connection with the standard, geometric intuition, several
definitions must be introduced (more geometric, and more algebraic
ones) and they must be proved equivalent. For example, when the
definition of angles is given only through algebraic operations on
matrices and their determinants, the angle preservation property is
very easy to prove, but for educational purposes, this becomes
relevant only when that definition is connected with the standard
definition of angle between curves (i.e., their tangent vectors) ---
otherwise, the formalization becomes a game with meaningless symbols.

Another important conclusion that we make is that in formal documents,
case analysis should be avoided and extensions that help avoiding it
should be pursued whenever possible (e.g., it was much better to use
the homogeneous coordinates instead of a single distinguished infinity
point, it was much simpler to work with circlines then to distinguish
between circles and lines, etc.). Keeping different models of the same
concept (for example, in our case, homogeneous coordinates and the
Riemann sphere) also helps, as some proofs are easier in one, and some
proofs are easier in other models.

In principle, our proofs are not long (15-20 lines in
average). However, some tedious reasoning was sometimes required,
especially when switching between real and complex numbers (by the
conversion functions {\tt Re} and {\tt cor}). These conversion are
usually not present in informal texts and some better automation of
reasoning about these functions would be welcome. Isabelle's
automation was quite powerful in equational reasoning about ordinary
complex numbers using {\tt (simp add: field\_simps)} (with some minor
exceptions), but in the presence of inequalities, the automation was
not so good and we had to prove many things manually, that would be
considered trivial in informal texts.

In our further work we plan to use these results for formalizing
non-Euclidean geometries and their models (especially, spherical model
of the elliptic geometry and the Poincar\'e disc and upper half-plane
models of hyperbolic geometry).
